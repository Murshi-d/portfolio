String about = '''
I first stepped into the world of coding during my degree, where I built my project using Python. That experience sparked my interest in programming and led me to explore new technologies. After graduation, I discovered Flutter and was immediately drawn to its versatility and power. I dedicated myself to learning the framework, building apps, and sharpening my skills.

Now, I’ve been working as a Flutter developer for the past 1.5 years. I enjoy crafting clean, maintainable code and building smooth, user-friendly interfaces. Debugging and solving problems push me to think creatively, and every challenge helps me grow as a developer.

Outside of coding, I like to keep things balanced—whether that’s spending time relaxing, learning something new, or just enjoying a good break.

Overall, I’m passionate about creating impactful mobile experiences and excited to continue growing in my journey as a developer.
